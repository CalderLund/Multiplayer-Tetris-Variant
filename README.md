# Multiplayer-Tetris-Variant
This version of the classic game Tetris is a multiplayer variant which allows for many power ups and additional features not found in normal Tetris. 

The project was used as a way to learn various desing patterns, including the factory design pattern, the observer pattern, the decorator pattern, template method pattern, and more. Additionally, the project aimed to fortify our knowledge of Object Oriented Programming and good control of virtual memory. 

This code contains no memory leaks and is well-tested for bugs.
